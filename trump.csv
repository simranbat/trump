"Remarks at Luedecke Arena in Austin, Texas","On November 8th, we are going to declare our independence from special interests, corrupt politicians, and from a rigged system that benefits only the insiders.

We are going to declare our independence from media executives that don't care about us, and politicians who don't listen to us.

We are going to declare our independence from rising crime, soaring poverty and crushing debt.

We are going to declare our independence from failures of the past and create a New American Future.

Once again, we will have a government of, by, and for the people.

Americanism, not globalism, will be our credo.

It's going to be America First from now on.

Let me tell you what this new future looks like.

We are going to cut taxes and create millions of new jobs.

We are going to repeal and replace Obamacare.

We are going to appoint judges who will support, defend and uphold the Constitution of the United States.

We are going to save and cherish the 2nd amendment.

We will ensure every Veteran in this country has the right to seek medical treatment at a VA facility, or with the private doctor of their choice.

We're going to eliminate job-killing regulations.

We are going to unleash an American Energy Revolution.

Let's talk about another issue that is important to our future, and the future of our children.

That's the issue of crime. Violent crime is rising across the country. More than 2,700 have been shot in Chicago alone this year.

No American should consider this level of crime acceptable. Every American has the right to live in safety and peace.

A Trump Administration is going to restore law and order.

Let me take this opportunity to thank our wonderful police and law enforcement officers. This state has known unbelievable heartache in recent days after the murder of 5 police officers, and the wounding of another 7, in the assault on Dallas. We pray for the families, and hope for the speedy recovery of the wounded.

To all law enforcement in America: we are with you, we support you, and we will always stand with you.

Together, we will create a safe community for every citizen in the land – but especially those who have not known safety in a very, very long time.

That includes appointing an Attorney General and a Secretary of Homeland Security who are completely committed to upholding the law.

I will appoint federal officials and investigators who will work hand-in-hand with police and citizens to dismantle gangs, cartels and criminal syndicates terrorizing our people.

I will appoint prosecutors who will go into the most dangerous communities in America and work to liberate our citizens from violence and fear.

All citizens deserve to be protected. No American left behind.

I want every African-American parent in this country – and all parents in this country – to be able to raise their kids in safety.

And I want to ensure every African-American child in this country – and all children in this country – are put on the American ladder of success: a good education, and a good-paying job.

We are going to have school choice, charter schools, and merit-pay for teachers. My opponent, Hillary Clinton, discriminates against African-American students by opposing school choice because she is owned and paid for by the education bureaucracy.

No one owns me. I answer only to the American people.

In a New York Post column, Deroy Murdock, published data confirming what I've been saying about the devastating economic conditions in the African-American communities. Murdock confirms these facts:

""The overall labor force participation rate for black Americans has slipped from 63.2 percent to 61.2 percent — down 3.2 percent.

This metric also slumped for black teenagers, from 29.6 percent to 27.7 percent — down 6.4 percent.

The percentage of black Americans in poverty has grown under Obama, the Census Bureau reports, from 25.8 percent in 2009 to 26.2 percent in 2014 — up 1.6 percent.

The number of blacks on Food Stamps soared under Obama — from 7.4 million in 2009 to 11.7 million in 2014 — up 58.2 percent.

Also, from Obama's arrival through last June 30, the percentage of black Americans who own homes plunged from 46.1 to 41.7 percent, the Census reports — down 9.5 percent.""

Nearly 4 in 10 African American children live in poverty. 58 percent of young African Americans are not employed.

Homicide is up nearly 50 percent in Washington D.C. and up more than 60 percent in Baltimore. Violent crime rose 17 percent in the fifty largest US cities.

This is the legacy of President Obama and Hillary Clinton.

To those suffering I say: what do you have to lose by trying something new?

Let me also tell you what you have to gain: more jobs, higher wages, and a massive reduction in the terrible crime plaguing our inner cities.

We are going to turn it all around. Success must be created for everyone, and available to everyone.

That is how we are going to create a New American Future.

But to make every American safe and prosperous, we must address one of the most vital issues of all: Border Security.

We are going to build a wall.

We are going to enforce the law.

We are going to protect your jobs and wages.

And we are going to keep our country safe.

According to the Texas government, nearly two hundred thousand illegal immigrants were booked into Texas jails between 2011 and 2016. Collectively, those arrested were responsible for more than half a million criminal offenses, including 1,055 homicides, 5,516 sexual assault charges and more than 50,000 charges of either burglary or theft.

Yet, Hillary Clinton wants a totally, completely open border.

She wants catch-and-release.

Obamacare for illegal immigrants.

Massive amnesty in her first 100 days.

She wants to gut immigration enforcement.

She supports Sanctuary Cities.

She wants to let people overstay their visas without removal.

One lawless order after another.

We must not let it happen.

Hillary Clinton also wants a 550% increase in Syrian refugees. There have been hundreds of immigrants and their children charged with terrorism inside the United States since 9/11, and a number of terrible attacks like the Boston Bombing, San Bernardino and Orlando. Yet Hillary Clinton wants to fling open the floodgates even wider.

I want to create safe zones in the Middle East. My plan suspends visas when we can't perform effective screening, and it puts forward a new ideological screening program to keep out people from our country who don't support our values. After all, that is what taking the oath of citizenship is all about.

This election will decide whether or not we have a border.

This election will decide whether or not we have a country.

Today I met with the moms of American children killed by illegal immigrants as a result of the policies Hillary Clinton supports. Hillary Clinton will never meet with these families, she will never hear these stories.

These are all forgotten Americans – they are not Hollywood or media stars, or big money special interest donors.

She is bought-and-paid-for by the special interests.

This corruption relates closely to another corruption scandal that strikes at the heart of our Democracy. Every day more and more alarming facts come out.

The scandal I speak of is the State Department's Pay-For-Play Scandal under Hillary Clinton.

If our Secretary of State can be bought, or bribed, or sell or trade government favors, then the whole American system is threatened.

It is a threat to the foundation of Democracy itself. This is what happens in a Third World country – it's the failed conditions people flee when they come to America.

America can never elect a candidate who, like Hillary Clinton, did government favors for those giving her family and her foundation massive amounts of cash.

The new revelations about Hillary Clinton's email scandal make clear we have only seen the tip of the iceberg.

Hillary Clinton is desperate to cover-up her crimes. That's why she deleted 33,000 emails. That's also why she lied repeatedly to Congress and the American public.

She said she never sent or received classified materials.

That was a lie, proved over and over again.

She claimed she used an insecure email server for the convenience of using only one device. But she used multiple devices.

Another lie.

Under penalty of perjury, she said she turned over all of her work-related emails. But the FBI found thousands she never turned over, and now just found another 15,000 more.

Another Clinton lie.

She said she sent nothing marked classified.

A total lie, unmasked to the world. And more to come.

She said her server was secure, and had no breaches. But we know now it was completely unsecure, and the FBI Director said it could easily be hacked by our foreign enemies.

More Clinton lies.

Clinton said her lawyers reviewed all of her emails before destroying them.

One more Hillary Clinton lie.

Lie after lie after lie.

Hillary Clinton is unfit to hold public office.

It is impossible to figure out where the Clinton Foundation ends and the State Department begins. It is now abundantly clear that the Clintons' set up a business to profit from public office. They sold access and specific actions by and to them for money.

It goes back to the Arkansas days, and it continued during the White House days with the sale of the Lincoln Bedroom to large donors.

But once Bill was out of office the small time Clinton business – or, more accurately, their crime enterprise – grew with the roles reversed. Bill, now an ex-President collected the money for the Clinton Foundation and Hillary Clinton had the public offices to sell; Senator, Secretary of State and for all that time a potential President. They turned this into an exponentially larger business.

But it was more than a business, it was a continuing big time criminal enterprise. It involved numerous violations of the conflict of interest and bribery laws and other serious laws of the United States.

The e-mails and phone logs show that the Clinton Foundation and the Clinton Department of State were one and the same. If you donated to the Clinton Foundation or paid massive speaking fees to Bill Clinton, you got an entry to the Department of State. Together they constituted the most scandalous and certainly most profitable sale of public office since the Teapot Dome Scandal of the 1920s.

Today a phone log was released for Cheryl Mills. She was Secretary of State Clinton's Chief of Staff. You would expect the log to contain only calls concerning Department of State business. But Cheryl Mills received 148 messages between 2010 and 2012 from the Chief Operating Officer of the Clinton Foundation – no other individual or group appears to have left that many messages.

We also just learned today that more than half the people who met with Hillary Clinton from outside government while she was Secretary of State were donors to the Foundation.

This creates the nexus which is at the core of a RICO case. In other words, they merged the two into the Clinton Family racketeering enterprise.

The specific crimes committed to carry out that enterprise are too numerous to cover in this speech. I walked through two of them yesterday – the sale of U.S. Uranium to Russia, and the exemption of a telecom giant from sanctions after they paid Bill Clinton for a speech.

The UBS saga is another one. Shortly after Hillary Clinton became Secretary of State she went to Geneva and intervened in a dispute concerning secret identities of Americans.

She negotiated a very good deal for UBS and a very bad deal for law enforcement. Of the 52,000 accounts the U.S. was seeking, the government settled for only 4,450 accounts. Her intervention was described by Treasury as unusual.

Before her unusual intervention UBS had donated only $60,000 to the Foundation. After the Clinton favor for UBS, it opened its wallet for big bucks and out came a $600,000 contribution, a $32 million loan and a $1.5 million speaking fee for Bill Clinton.

This is corruption, pure and simple.

This is why I have called for a special prosecutor.

Justice is supposed to be blind. It's never supposed to be for sale.

In the long-run, there is only one way to end the corruption in our country: elect Donald J. Trump.

Hillary Clinton thinks she is above the law. Come November, the American people will show her that she is not.

You will be voting for justice, fairness and equality.

You will also be voting for a more inclusive country, where no one is left out.

Another 2 million Latinos have joined the ranks of those in poverty. Incomes for Latino households have declined by nearly $1,000 under President Obama. The number of Latino children living in poverty increased by 15 percent.

Our pro-growth, pro-jobs, pro-family agenda is going to bring hope back to every community in our nation. I will dedicate myself to restore the ladder of success to all those who live in poverty.

We reject the bigotry of Hillary Clinton, who sees communities of color only as votes, not as human beings worthy of a better future.

The era of division is coming to end. We will create a new future of American unity.

Are you ready for real American change?

It is time to emphasize what we all have in common as Americans.

We will promote our common culture, values and principles.

We will be one nation.

We will be one people.

We will share together one great future.

It's going to be America First.

Together, we will make America proud again.

We will make America prosperous again.

We will make America safe again.

Friends, citizens and fellow Americans: We will make America great again."
"Remarks at the Charlotte Convention Center in Charlotte, North Carolina","I'd like to take a moment to talk about the heartbreak and devastation in Louisiana, a state that is very special to me.

We are one nation. When one state hurts, we all hurt – and we must all work together to lift each other up. Working, building, restoring together.

Our prayers are with the families who have lost loved ones, and we send them our deepest condolences. Though words cannot express the sadness one feels at times like this, I hope everyone in Louisiana knows that our country is praying for them and standing with them to help them in these difficult hours.

We are one country, one people, and we will have together one great future.

Tonight, I'd like to talk about the New American Future we are going to create together.

Last week, I laid out my plan to bring jobs back to our country.

On Monday, I laid out my plan to defeat Radical Islamic Terrorism.

On Tuesday, in Wisconsin, I talked about how we are going to restore law and order to this country.

Let me take this opportunity to extend our thanks and our gratitude to the police and law enforcement officers in this country who have sacrificed so greatly in these difficult times.

The chaos and violence on our streets, and the assaults on law enforcement, are an attack against all peaceful citizens. If I am elected President, this chaos and violence will end – and it will end very quickly.

Every single citizen in our land has a right to live in safety.

To be one united nation, we must protect all of our people. But we must also provide opportunities for all of our people.

We cannot make America great again if we leave any community behind.

Nearly Four in ten African-American children are living in poverty.I will not rest until children of every color in this country are fully included in the American Dream.

Jobs, safety, opportunity. Fair and equal representation. This is what I promise to African-Americans, Hispanic-Americans, and all Americans.

But to achieve this New American Future we must break from the failures of the past.

As you know, I am not a politician. I have worked in business, creating jobs and rebuilding neighborhoods my entire adult life. I've never wanted to learn the language of the insiders, and I've never been politically correct – it takes far too much time, and can often make more difficult.

Sometimes, in the heat of debate and speaking on a multitude of issues, you don't choose the right words or you say the wrong thing. I have done that, and I regret it, particularly where it may have caused personal pain. Too much is at stake for us to be consumed with these issues.

But one thing I can promise you is this: I will always tell you the truth.

I speak the truth for all of you, and for everyone in this country who doesn't have a voice.

I speak the truth on behalf of the factory worker who lost his or her job.

I speak the truth on behalf of the Veteran who has been denied the medical care they need – and so many are not making it. They are dying.

I speak the truth on behalf of the family living near the border that deserves to be safe in their own country but is instead living with no security at all.

Our campaign is about representing the great majority of Americans – Republicans, Democrats, Independents, Conservatives and Liberals – who read the newspaper, or turn on the TV, and don't hear anyone speaking for them. All they hear are insiders fighting for insiders.

These are the forgotten men and women in our society, and they are angry at so much on so many levels. The poverty, the unemployment, the failing schools, the jobs moving to other countries.

I am fighting for these forgotten Americans.

Fourteen months ago, I declared my campaign for the Presidency on the promise to give our government back to the people. Every day since then, I've worked to repay the loyalty and the faith that you have put in me.

Every day I think about how much is at stake for this country. This isn't just the fight of my life, it's the fight ofour lives – together – to save our country.

I refuse to let another generation of American children be excluded from the American Dream. Our whole country loses when young people of limitless potential are denied the opportunity to contribute their talents because we failed to provide them the opportunities they deserved. Let our children be dreamers too.

Our whole country loses every time a kid doesn't graduate from high school, or fails to enter the workforce or, worse still, is lost to the dreadful world of drugs and crime.

When I look at the failing schools, the terrible trade deals, and the infrastructure crumbling in our inner cities, I know all of this can be fixed - and it can be fixed very quickly.

In the world I come from, if something is broken, you fix it.

If something isn't working, you replace it.

If a product doesn't deliver, you make a change.

I have no patience for injustice, no tolerance for government incompetence, no sympathy for leaders who fail their citizens.

That's why I am running: to end the decades of bitter failure and to offer the American people a new future of honesty, justice and opportunity. A future where America, and its people, always – and I mean always – come first.

Aren't you tired of a system that gets rich at your expense?

Aren't you tired of the same old lies and the same old broken promises? And Hillary Clinton has proven to be one of the greatest liars of all time.

Aren't you tired of arrogant leaders who look down on you, instead of serving and protecting you?

That is all about to change – and it's about to change soon. We are going to put the American people first again.

I've travelled all across this country laying out my bold and modern agenda for change.

In this journey, I will never lie to you. I will never tell you something I do not believe. I will never put anyone's interests ahead of yours.

And, I will never, ever stop fighting for you.

I have no special interest. I am spending millions of dollars on my own campaign – nobody else is.

My only interest is the American people.

So while sometimes I can be too honest, Hillary Clinton is the exact opposite: she never tells the truth. One lie after another, and getting worse each passing day.

The American people are still waiting for Hillary Clinton to apologize for all of the many lies she's told to them, and the many times she's betrayed them.

Tell me, has Hillary Clinton ever apologized for lying about her illegal email server and deleting 33,000 emails?

Has Hillary Clinton apologized for turning the State Department into a pay-for-play operation where favors are sold to the highest bidder?

Has she apologized for lying to the families who lost loved ones at Benghazi?

Has she apologized for putting Iran on the path to nuclear weapons?

Has she apologized for Iraq? For Libya? For Syria? Has she apologized for unleashing ISIS across the world?

Has Hillary Clinton apologized for the decisions she made that have led to so much death, destruction and terrorism?

Speaking of lies, we now know from the State Department announcement that President Obama lied about the $400 million dollars in cash that was flown to Iran. He denied it was for the hostages, but it was. He said we don't pay ransom, but he did. He lied about the hostages – openly and blatantly – just like he lied about Obamacare.

Now the Administration has put every American travelling overseas, including our military personnel, at greater risk of being kidnapped. Hillary Clinton owns President Obama's Iran policy, one more reason she can never be allowed to be President.

Let's talk about the economy. Here, in this beautiful state, so many people have suffered because of NAFTA. Bill Clinton signed the deal, and Hillary Clinton supported it. North Carolina has lost nearly half of its manufacturing jobs since NAFTA went into effect.

Bill Clinton also put China into the World Trade Organization – another Hillary Clinton-backed deal. Your city of Charlotte has lost 1 in 4 manufacturing jobs since China joined the WTO, and many of these jobs were lost while Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State – our chief diplomat with China. She was a disaster, totally unfit for the job.

Hillary Clinton owes the State of North Carolina a very big apology, and I think you'll get that apology around the same time you'll get to see her 33,000 deleted emails.

Another major issue in this campaign has been the border. Our open border has allowed drugs and crime and gangs to pour into our communities. So much needless suffering, so much preventable death. I've spent time with the families of wonderful Americans whose loved ones were killed by the open borders and Sanctuary Cities that Hillary Clinton supports.

I've embraced the crying parents who've lost their children to violence spilling across our border. Parents like Laura Wilkerson and Michelle Root and Sabine Durden and Jamiel Shaw whose children were killed by illegal immigrants.

My opponent supports Sanctuary Cities.

But where was the Sanctuary for Kate Steinle? Where was the Sanctuary for the children of Laura, Michelle, Sabine and Jamiel?

Where was the Sanctuary for every other parent who has suffered so horribly?

These moms and dads don't get a lot of consideration from our politicians. They certainly don't get apologies. They'll never even get the time of day from Hillary Clinton.

But they will always come first to me.

Listen closely: we will deliver justice for all of these American Families. We will create a system of immigration that makes us all proud.

Hillary Clinton's mistakes destroy innocent lives, sacrifice national security, and betray the working families of this country.

Please remember this: I will never put personal profit before national security. I will never leave our border open to appease donors and special interests. I will never support a trade deal that kills American jobs. I will never put the special interests before the national interest. I will never put a donor before a voter, or a lobbyist before a citizen.

Instead, I will be a champion for the people.

The establishment media doesn't cover what really matters in this country, or what's really going on in people's lives. They will take words of mine out of context and spend a week obsessing over every single syllable, and then pretend to discover some hidden meaning in what I said.

Just imagine for a second if the media spent this energy holding the politicians accountable who got innocent Americans like Kate Steinle killed – she was gunned down by an illegal immigrant who had been deported five times.

Just imagine if the media spent this much time investigating the poverty and joblessness in our inner cities.

Just think about how much different things would be if the media in this country sent their cameras to our border, or to our closing factories, or to our failing schools. Or if the media focused on what dark secrets must be hidden in the 33,000 emails Hillary Clinton deleted.

Instead, every story is told from the perspective of the insiders. It's the narrative of the people who rigged the system, never the voice of the people it's been rigged against.

So many people suffering in silence. No cameras, no coverage, no outrage from a media class that seems to get outraged over just about everything else.

So again, it's not about me. It's never been about me. It's about all the people in this country who don't have a voice.

I am running to be their voice.

I am running to be the voice for every forgotten part of this country that has been waiting and hoping for a better future.

I am glad that I make the powerful a little uncomfortable now and again – including some powerful people in my own party. Because it means I am fighting for real change.

There's a reason the hedge fund managers, the financial lobbyists, the Wall Street investors, are throwing their money at Hillary Clinton. Because they know she will make sure the system stays rigged in their favor.

It's the powerful protecting the powerful.

The insiders fighting for the insiders.

I am fighting for you.

Here is the change I propose.

On terrorism, we are going to end the era of nation-building and instead focus on destroying ISIS and Radical Islamic terrorism.

We will use military, cyber and financial warfare and work with any partner in the world, and the Middle East, that shares our goal of defeating terrorism. I have a message for the terrorists trying to kill our citizens: we will find you, we will destroy you, and we will win.

On immigration, we will temporarily suspend immigration from any place where adequate screening cannot be performed. All applicants for immigration will be vetted for ties to radical ideology, and we will screen out anyone who doesn't share our values and love our people. Anyone who believes Sharia law supplants American law will not be given an immigrant visa. If you want to join our society, then you must embrace our society, our values and our tolerant way of life. Those who believe in oppressing women, gays, Hispanics, African-Americans and people of different faiths are not welcome to join our country.

We will promote our America values, our American way of life, and our American system of government which are all the best in the world.

My opponent on the other hand wants a 550% increase in Syrian refugees. Her plan would bring in roughly 620,000 refugees from all refugee-sending nations in her first term, on top of all other immigration. Hillary Clinton is running to be America's Angela Merkel, and we've seen how much crime and how many problems that's caused the German people.

We have enough problems already, we don't need another one.

On crime, we are going to add more police, more investigators, and appoint the best judges and prosecutors in the world. We will pursue strong enforcement of federal laws.

The gangs and cartels and criminal syndicates terrorizing our people will be stripped apart one by one. Their day is over.

On trade, we are going to renegotiate NAFTA, withdraw from the TPP, stand up to China on our terrible trade agreement, and protect every last American job.

Hillary Clinton has supported all of the major trade deals that have stripped this country of its jobs and its wealth.

On taxes, we are going to massively cut tax rates for workers and small businesses – creating millions of new good paying jobs.

We are going to get rid of regulations that send jobs overseas and we are going to make it easier for young Americans to get the credit they need to start a small business and pursue their dreams.

On education, we are going to give students choice, and allow charter schools to thrive. We are going to end tenure policies that reward bad teachers and hurt good ones. My opponent wants to deny students choice and opportunity, all to get a little bit more money from the education bureaucracy. She doesn't care how many young dreams are dashed in the process.

We are going to work closely with African-American parents and students in the inner cities – and what a big difference that will make. This means a lot to me, and it is going to be a top priority in a Trump Administration.

On healthcare, we are going to repeal and replace Obamacare. Countless Americans have been forced into part-time jobs, premiums are about to jump by double-digits yet again, and just this week Aetna announced it is pulling out of the exchanges in North Carolina. We are going to replace this disaster with reforms that give you choice and freedom and control in healthcare – at a much lower cost.

On political corruption, we are going to restore honor to our government.

In my Administration, I am going to enforce all laws concerning the protection of classified information. No one will be above the law.

I am going to forbid senior officials from trading favors for cash by preventing them from collecting lavish speaking fees through their spouses when they serve.

I am going to ask my senior officials to sign an agreement not to accept speaking fees from corporations with a registered lobbyist for five years after leaving office, or from any entity tied to a foreign government.

Finally, we are going to bring this country together. We are going to do it by emphasizing what we all have in common as Americans. We are going to reject the bigotry of Hillary Clinton, which sees communities of color only as votes and not as human beings worthy of a better future.

If African-American voters give Donald Trump a chance by giving me their vote, the result for them will be amazing. Look at how badly things are going under decades of Democratic leadership – look at the schools, look at the 58% of young African-Americans not working. It is time for change.

What do you have to lose by trying something new? – I will fix it. This means so much to me, and I will work as hard as I can to bring new opportunity to places in our country which have not known opportunity in a very long time.

Hillary Clinton and the Democratic Party have taken African-American votes totally for granted. Because the votes have been automatically there, there has been no reason for Democrats to produce.

It is time to break with the failures of the past, and to fight for every last American child in this country to have the better future they deserve.

In my Administration, every American will be treated equally, protected equally, and honored equally. We will reject bigotry and hatred and oppression in all of its forms, and seek a new future built on our common culture and values as one American people.

This is the change I am promising all of you: an honest government, a fair economy, and a just society for each and every American.

But we can never fix our problems by relying on the same politicians who created these problems in the first place.

72% of voters say our country is on the wrong track. I am the change candidate, Hillary Clinton is the failed status quo.

It is time to vote for a New American Future.

Together, We will make America strong again.

We will make American proud again.

We will make America safe again.

Friends and fellow citizens: Come November, we will make America great again.

Thank You, and God Bless."

The people of Jackson and the state of Mississippi have such incredible energy, that very powerful word ""energy,"" unbelievable, incredible energy and spirit, folks. Thank you very much. 
And thank you for all the support you've given me right from the beginning. I will not forget it, Mississippi. We love Mississippi right from the beginning, right from the beginning. [applause] 
This is the spirit we need to rebuild our country a hundred percent. [applause] 
And this is our chance to break free from the bitter failures of the past and to create a new American future. [applause] 
To everyone watching across our nation right now, to everyone who has been let down by our terrible, terrible politicians, I am asking for your vote on November 8th. [applause] 
This is your chance to remove the special interests from their throne of power and to once again have a government of, by and for the people. [applause] 
No one will be left behind anymore. [applause] 
I'd like to take this moment to send our thoughts and prayers to everyone at the American University in Kabul, Afghanistan. They are going through a lot. 
We must defeat radical Islamic terrorism! [applause] 
Anyone who will not name our enemy is not fit to lead our country. [applause] 
Eight years of Obama/Clinton policies have sacrificed our safety and undermined our freedom and independence. Our jobs have moved to other countries. Islamic terrorism has spread within our shores. And an open border has crushed low-income workers and threatened, and I mean totally threatened, our security. [applause] 
The issues we face here in America are similar to the issues faced in Britain during their referendum on membership in the European Union. This is the movement known as Brexit. 
On June 23rd, the people of Britain voted to declare their independence, which is what we're looking to do also, folks [applause] 
From their international government which hasn't worked. They voted to break away from rule by large corporations and media executives who believe in a world without borders. [booing] 
They voted to reclaim control over immigration, over their economy, over their government. [booing] 
Working people and the great people of the U.K. took control of their destiny. [applause] 
The people profiting from the rigged system, and it is rigged, we're finding it out every single day, the multinational banks, the media celebrities, the big donors tried to scare the British people out of voting for change. The same thing is happening right here in the United States. It's happening. 
All the people benefiting from our rigged system don't want things to change. They want you to believe things can't be changed. 
And they can so easily, so easily and so smartly. 
And we all know things have to change. We have no choice. And they have to change right now. [applause] 
Before the vote, I said that Britain would leave the EU, sometimes referred to as European Union, and I said it and I took a lot of heat when I said it. People said, what does he know, what does he know? And guess what? I was very supportive of their right to do it and to take control of their own future, like exactly what we're going to be voting for on November 8th. [applause] 
Hillary Clinton, who has been on the wrong side of history in every major decision, she's only made bad decisions, she's got bad judgment, she doesn't know what she's doing, folks. [booing] 
She got this one wrong, too. 
She got this one wrong, too, folks. She got this one wrong, too. She gets them all wrong. She gets them all wrong, doesn't she? She really got the e-mails wrong, that I can tell you. [laughter] 
And now Hillary wants to surrender America to globalism, just what we don't want. [booing] 
She wants a country without borders. She wants trade deals written for the benefit of foreign corporations. She wants a government that ignores the will of the people. [booing] 
She wants to sell out American security to the Clinton Foundation for a big, fat pile of cash. [booing] 
It's hard to tell where the Clinton Foundation ends and where the State Department begins. 
According to the Associated Press, more than half the meetings she took as secretary of state with people outside government were with foundation donors. [booing] 
Hillary Clinton does not believe in America first. We believe in America first. [applause] 
Hillary believes in donors first and special interests and lobbyists. She will never straighten out our country. She doesn't have the strength, the stamina or the ability to straighten out our country. We'll have four more years of Obama and that's just what we don't want. [booing] 
She would rather give a job to a refugee from overseas than an unemployed American veteran or to an unemployed African American or Hispanic. [booing] 
The job of a public official is to serve and protect the citizens of the United States [applause] 
Not illegal immigrants, not foreign nationals seeking entry, but the people living here lawfully today, including millions of African-American and Hispanic citizens, millions, millions being treated very, very unfairly, I can tell you that. 
My focus will always be on the well-being of more than 300 million American citizens who call this country home and who love their country. [applause] 
I will fight for their security. I will fight for their jobs. We will not let jobs be taken out of our country, be ripped out of our country and moved to Mexico and many other countries. We will not let it happen anymore. [applause] 
We'll be fighting for their jobs and we'll be fighting for your families, that I can tell you. It ends. What's been going on ends on November 8th. [applause] 
We will have one American nation, not divided, we will be together. Hillary Clinton has betrayed her duty to the people. November 8th is our chance to re-declare American independence. [applause] 
This is a great honor for me. I am going right now to invite onto the stage the man behind Brexit and a man who led brilliantly the United Kingdom Independence Party in this fight and won despite all odds, despite horrible name-calling, despite so many obstacles. 
Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Nigel Farage. [applause]
Wow! Thank you, Nigel. 
What a job! What a job he did. What a job he did against all odds. 
Thank you, Nigel. 
That was some job that he did against all odds. Everybody said it couldn't be done. And by the way, it's looking like a very wise decision right now by the voters, so I really congratulate Nigel and I thank you for being here. Thank you. [applause] 
And if I may, we had some tremendous polls come out today. I won't bring it up, I refuse to mention it, but they were very good. We're leading in a lot of locations. [applause] 
Thank you. 
It's time for America to recapture, like you just heard, to recapture our destiny. Our government leaders and our media have totally lost touch with the people. They have, they have totally lost touch. 
You need no better evidence of that then the fact that the media ignores the plight of Americans who have lost their children to illegal immigrants, but spends day after day pushing for amnesty for those here in total violation of the law. We can't allow that. [booing] 
Why do our leaders spend so much time talking about how to help people here illegally, they're here illegally, and they spend and they work and they try so hard to help them, but they don't try helping American citizens, some of whom have been devastated by what's happened to their children and their families? Devastated. 
jobs, wages and security for Americans. [applause] 
And the immigration policy I support as president must pass these three tests. First, it must improve jobs and wages for United States citizens. [applause] 
We have people in this room who were making more money in real wages 18 years ago, were not working as hard as they're working now and they've gotten older, not supposed to be that way, and in many cases and largely because of the disaster known as ""Obamacare"" they have to hold two jobs, not one, but two jobs and, in some cases, three jobs. 
Not going to happen, folks, not going to happen. 
Second, it must improve the safety and security for United States citizens. [applause] 
Third, it must improve the quality of life for U.S. citizens. The quality of life, our quality of life is going down. 
Our level of security, you look back years, you're more insecure now in terms of security than you were 10, 15 and 20 years ago. 
Hillary Clinton's radical immigration plan fails these tests and it fails them very, very badly. Her push for open borders will lower the wages and kill the jobs of lawful American residents. [booing] 
Her support for catch-and-release will put innocent American lives at risk and already has, just like President Obama released the illegal immigrant at the border who then killed magnificent, magnificent Sarah Root. 
Yesterday I met with her mom, Michelle. Hillary Clinton only talks about the separation of families who choose to come here illegally. I want to focus on the American families who have been permanently separated from their children because of the sanctuary cities and open borders that Hillary Clinton so strongly supports. [booing] 
Where is the sanctuary for American children? Where is that sanctuary? The dreamers we never talk about are the young Americans. Why aren't young Americans dreamers also? I want my dreamers to be young Americans. [applause] 
Hillary Clinton also wants to push to bring in 620,000 refugees in her first term [booing] 
A large number of whom come from large countries where women and gays are horribly brutalized, which will weaken our tolerant way of life. 
I only want to bring people to our country who share our values and love our people and are capable of loving America. [applause] 
Importantly, I will also create millions and millions of jobs for our people. [applause] 
We are going to cut taxes, reduce regulations, fix our trade deals, unleash American energy and repeal and replace the horror show known as ""Obamacare."" [applause] 
We are going to create jobs, jobs, jobs! [applause] 
I will be the greatest jobs president that God ever created, believe me. [applause] 
So we're going to have millions and millions of jobs, jobs like you have never seen in this country before, because our jobs are being stolen from us, our companies are being stolen from us, our manufacturing is down by 40 percent and 50 percent and numbers that nobody even believes. Those days will be over if Donald Trump is elected president of the United States, believe me. [applause] 
Rising incomes, higher wages, thousands of new companies all across this nation, they'll come in and they'll form. We are going to renegotiate the worst trade deal ever made, not only in this country, but anywhere in the world, known as NAFTA and signed by Bill Clinton. [booing] 
We're going to stand up to China on trade. We're going to keep out of what will be a disastrous trade deal, Trans-Pacific Partnership, TPP. [booing] 
It will not happen with me. It will absolutely happen with crooked Hillary, believe me. 
This state has lost more than 40 percent of its manufacturing jobs since Bill Clinton signed NAFTA, and it's lost one in four manufacturing jobs since he put China into the World Trade Organization, both deals supported by Hillary Clinton. Horrible deals, destructive deals, what those deals have done to our jobs and to our country. 
We are going to bring back jobs to Mississippi [applause] 
And in North Carolina, which has treated me so well, and Ohio and to Michigan where our auto plants are leaving and leaving and leaving and going to Mexico and other places, and to Pennsylvania, where I went to school, and to Maryland and all across this land. We're going to bring our jobs back and we're not going to let our jobs be taken away. [applause] 
Thank you. Thank you. 
And I'm going to make it my personal mission to bring opportunity, safety and prosperity to our very, very troubled inner cities. [applause] 
The Democratic Party has failed and betrayed the African-American community. [booing] 
Democratic crime policies, education policies and economic policies have produced only more crime, more broken homes and more poverty than we've ever had in those communities before. [booing] 
Nearly four in 10 African-American children live in poverty. Fifty-eight percent of African-American youth are not working. More than 2,700 people have been shot in Chicago since the beginning of this year alone. [booing] 
Violent crime has risen 17 percent, and in America's 50 largest cities it's only going one way, folks, and that's up. Homicides are up nearly 50 percent in Washington, D.C. and more than 60 percent from last year in Baltimore. 
The Democratic Party has taken the votes of African Americans totally for granted, and they've done nothing in return. [booing] 
They've just assumed they'll get your support and they've done nothing, absolutely nothing to deserve it. 
It's time to give the Democrats some competition for African- American votes and for Hispanic votes. [applause] 
It's time to rebuild the inner cities of America and do it properly. It's time to reject the failed leadership of a rigged political system. And I was the first to use that term, it's a rigged, disgusting system. [applause] 
To those hurting and suffering and left behind, I say, what do you have to lose by trying something new? What do you have to lose by voting for Donald Trump for president? What do you have to lose? I will fix the problem. I will fix the problem. [applause] 
If you keep voting for the same people, you will keep getting the same horrible results. 
But I also want to talk about what you have to gain, right? Right? What do you have to gain? We will create school choice and allow charter schools to absolutely thrive. [applause] 
What else will we gain? We will empower young Americans to pursue their dreams of opening a small business and make it easier for them to get the credit that they need. [applause] 
We will renegotiate our horrible trade deals to bring back jobs and opportunity. And the African-American community and the Hispanic community will be our biggest beneficiary of that. [applause] 
We will lower taxes and unleash job creation and we will tap into trillions of dollars in new energy wealth that we never even knew we had before. [applause] 
We will protect your jobs from illegal immigration and broken visa programs. And we will rebuild the roads, the bridges, the infrastructure, the tunnels, the airports in your communities and we will rebuild it with our companies, with our steel and with our labor. [applause] 
Hillary Clinton is a bigot who sees people of color [applause] 
only as votes, not as human beings worthy of a better future. She's going to do nothing for African Americans. She's going to do nothing for the Hispanics. She's only going to take care of herself, her husband, her consultants, her donors. These are the people she cares about. She doesn't care what her policies have done to your communities. She doesn't care. 
Remember this. You've had her policies, Democrats running some of the inner cities for 50, 70, 80, even over a hundred years. And look what you have right now, poverty, no education, crime, you can't walk down the street with your child. We're going to fix it, we're going to fix it. [applause] 
Hillary Clinton has no remorse. I will fight to create a better future for every American. The hedge fund managers and Wall Street donors are throwing money at Hillary Clinton to try and stop our change agenda. 
Of course, if they start looking at the polls they may stop doing that. [applause] 
They're going to have to start studying those polls. That's why you need to come out and you have to vote, you have to vote. [applause] 
That is why you must make your voice heard on November 8th, have to do it. [applause] 
Another crucial issue in this race is national security. Hillary Clinton may go down as the worst secretary of state that has ever served in that office. [booing] 
Let's look back at the Middle East at the very beginning of 2009 before the Obama/Clinton administration, that I call a catastrophe, took over. Libya was stable. Syria was under control. Iraq was experiencing a reduction in violence. The group that would become what we now call ISIS was close to being extinguished, would never have happened. Iran was being choked off by economic sanctions. 
Fast forward to today. After spending $4 trillion, maybe $5 trillion, nobody even knows how much money has been sucked out of our country, what have the decisions of Obama/Clinton produced? 
Libya is in ruins. Our ambassador and three other brave Americans are dead. And ISIS has gained a new base of operations, they're all over the world 
Syria is in the midst of a totally disastrous civil war. ISIS controls large portions of the territory. 
A refugee crisis now threatens Europe and is threatening the United States because Hillary is allowing these people to pour into our country and we don't know who they are, where they come from. We know nothing. 
Iraq is in chaos and ISIS is on the loose. 
ISIS has spread across the Middle East and into the west. At the same time, ISIS is trying to infiltrate refugee flows into Europe and definitely folks, definitely, I have been very good at predicting, definitely to the United States. [booing] 
Iran has become the world's largest state sponsor of terrorism, is now flush with up to $150 billion in cash released by the United States, plus another $400 million in cash, cash, cash ransom [booing] 
That President Obama said had nothing to do with ransom, had nothing to do with the hostages, and his own people said he was wrong. [booing] 
He lied. He lied. Just like he said Obamacare, ""keep your plan, you'll keep your doctor,"" 28 times, ""keep your plan, keep your doctor."" And because of that lie, Democrats that would have never passed it passed it and now they regret that they passed it because it is a total disaster. [booing] 
Worst of all, the nuclear deal puts Iran, the number-one state sponsor of radical Islamic terrorism, on a path to nuclear weapons. In short, the Obama/Clinton foreign policy has unleashed ISIS, destabilized the Middle East and put the nation of Iran, which chants, constantly chants ""death to America"" in a dominant position of regional power and in fact aspiring to be a dominant world power. And we put them there over the last three years! [booing] 
This is the legacy of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton: death, destruction, terrorism and weakness. [booing] 
But Hillary Clinton's legacy does not have to be America's legacy. We're going to end the era of nation-building, a disastrous concept, a disastrous era, and create new foreign policy joined by our partners in the Middle East that is focused completely on destroying ISIS. We have no choice destroying ISIS. [applause] 
We will extend a hand of friendship to any nation that will work with us in good faith on this vital mission. 
I have a message for the terrorists trying to kill our people, our citizens, trying to hurt the world, but trying to hurt the United States: We will find you, we will destroy you and we will win! [applause] 
Thank you. Thank you. 
This is not only a military fight, but it will also require cyber warfare and financial warfare. It's also an ideological fight. We will confront directly the hateful, it's just so hateful, ideology of radical Islam and promote American values and American culture and America's system of government. 
Only by standing up for and supporting, we have to stand up for and support, our values can we become a united country once again [applause] 
A country of great jobs and wealth, a country of security and freedom, a country of strength and unity. The future is limitless. All we have to do is believe in America once again. We have to believe it can happen. It can happen. [applause] 
We will put back our faith in America's special destiny. We will lift the burdens on small business which is being driven into extinction by what's happening in our government. We'll create a level playing field for American workers. We'll never ever let what's happened to them happen to them again. We'll establish justice and opportunity and safety in every community in the land. 
I am asking for the vote of every citizen in this country, African American, Hispanic, all Americans, all Americans who want a better, brighter and stronger future for yourselves and for our country. [applause] 
I am the change candidate. This is our moment to show the whole world that America is back, bigger and better and stronger than ever before. [applause] 
I am asking for your vote so I can be your champion in the White House. I will be your champion and I will work hard to be your champion. 
And I won't be playing golf instead of going to see the people in Louisiana who have been devastated by floods. [applause] 
I'm going to be the champion to every parent who dreams for their children. And to every child who dreams for their future, I say these words to you tonight: I am with you, I will fight for you, and we will win for you, we will win. [applause] 
Together we will make America strong again, we will make America safe again, we will make America great again. 
Thank you and God bless you. Thank you, Mississippi. We love Mississippi. God bless you. Thank you. [applause]
"
"Remarks at the XFinity Arena in Everett, Washington","Thank you. I am so thrilled to be back in Washington. 
Together, we are going to work hard over the next 70 days and we are going to win this state – and we are going to win the White House. 
It's going to be a victory for the people. A victory for the everyday citizen whose voice hasn't been heard. 
It will be a win for the voters – not the pundits, not the journalists, not the lobbyists, not the global special interests funding my opponent's campaign. 
This is going to be YOUR victory. 
We are going to create the New American Future our children deserve. 
In this new future, millions of workers on the sidelines will be returned to the workforce. 
Crumbling roads, bridges and airports will be replaced with the infrastructure our country needs and deserves. 
Families trapped in welfare will be provided with jobs and opportunity. 
Government will become lean, effective, responsible – and honest. 
Our border will be protected, and our children will be safe. 
We will rebuild our inner cities, and provide safety and peace to all of our citizens. 
American values and culture will be cherished and celebrated once again. 
But to achieve this future, we must break free from the bitter failures of the past – and reject the same insiders telling us the same old lies. 
One area where honesty is badly needed is on the subject of economic and living conditions for African-American citizens in the United States. 
Millions of African-Americans in this country have succeeded greatly, and their contributions to every area of our life – now and throughout our history – should be celebrated and cherished. This includes the amazing achievements in art, science, sport, music, medicine, business and so much else. This includes millions of African-American entrepreneurs, innovators and the millions of African-American workers in our middle class. 
But we must also talk about those who have been left behind, the millions suffering in disastrous conditions in so many of our inner cities – and neighborhoods afflicted by poverty, drugs, and violence. 
No group in America has been more harmed by Hillary Clinton's policies than African-Americans. 
There is no better evidence of this fact than Hillary Clinton's immigration policy, which brings in illegal immigrants and refugees to take jobs from hardworking African-American and Hispanic citizens. 
Instead of providing free healthcare and jobs to millions of refugees from around the world, we should rebuild our inner cities and provide jobs to struggling Americans. 
Tonight, I am asking for the vote of every African-American and Hispanic citizen in this country who wants a better future. 
The inner cities of our country have been run by the Democratic Party for fifty, sixty, seventy years. 
These Democratic policies – the policies of Hillary Clinton – have produced only poverty, joblessness, failing schools, broken homes, and rising crime. 
Nearly 4 in 10 African-American children live in poverty, including 45% of children under the age of six. 58% of African-American youth are not working. Meanwhile, another 2 million Hispanic-Americans have been added to the ranks of those in poverty since 2009. 
In Detroit, half of all its residents do not work. In Milwaukee, almost 4 in 10 African-American men between the ages of 24-54 do not have a job. 
Here, in the state of Washington, 65% of Latino children and 60% of African-American children live in low-income households. 
Chicago just had the most violent month in 20 years. More than 2,800 have been shot in Chicago since the beginning of the year. 
It breaks our hearts. 
We cannot let this violence continue. It must be ended. 
Under A Trump Administration, it will be ended. 
It will be my priority to work with communities, local police, state police and federal law enforcement to dismantle the gangs and to liberate our citizens from violence and poverty and fear. I will appoint the best judges and prosecutors and federal investigators who will make this their personal mission. 
There is one thing which can no longer be denied: if you keep voting for the same people, you will keep getting the same results. To those suffering, I say: what do you have to lose by voting for Donald Trump? I will fix it. I will fight for you as no one ever has before. 
Let me also tell you what you have to gain: jobs, opportunity, security, and safety. 
This means so much to me. 
I believe every child in this country – in Detroit, in Baltimore, in Chicago – has the right to live out their lives in safety and peace. 
In the Wall Street Journal, Heather Mac Donald of the Manhattan Institute just wrote an important article about the soaring crime in our inner cities, and the responsibility of Democratic politicians for creating this problem. 
The article is called: ""Black Lives Matter to Donald Trump."" McDonald writes that ""Mr. Trump's call to restore law and order recognizes the right of inner-city residents to enjoy the same freedom from fear that the rest of America now takes for granted."" 
Freedom from violence is one of the great civil rights issues of our time. So too is the issue of school choice. 
We will fight for the right of parents to send their kids to the school that they believe gives their kids the best shot at success. 
I will not accept a future in which children of any color in this country are not fully included in the American Dream. Our whole country loses when we leave millions of talented, aspiring Americans on the sidelines. We want to give everyone a chance to contribute their full talents to our economy and our country. 
Remember: the Republican Party is the Party of Lincoln, the party of freedom, equality and opportunity. It is the Democratic Party that is the party of slavery, the party of Jim Crow, the party of oppression. 
Nothing makes me more honored and proud than to be the nominee of Abraham Lincoln's Republican Party. 
Our party will fight to bring hope to every forgotten stretch of this country. 
Once again, we will be One American Nation. 
One United People. 
And we will have One Great Future. 
That great future will be built on these three critical words: jobs, jobs, jobs. 
This will include a complete revitalization of our manufacturing sector, which has been so badly hurt by Hillary Clinton's policies. 
We are bringing the jobs back to our country. 
We are going to renegotiate NAFTA, keep out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, stand up to China, and fight for every last American job. 
The destruction that NAFTA started will be finished off if the Trans-Pacific Partnership is approved. 
That would be a disaster. We won't let it happen. 
But that's just the beginning of what we are going to do for American workers. 
On taxes, we are going to provide massive tax relief to all working people, and lower the tax rate on small business from 35% down to 15%. Low and middle-income parents will also be able to fully deduct the average cost of childcare from their taxes. 
On regulations, I am going to direct every agency and Department Head in my government to identify all needless and job-killing regulations and they will be removed. We will have a temporary moratorium on new regulations to allow our economy to grow and thrive. 
Economic growth for last quarter has been revised down to 1.1%, a total disaster. Meanwhile, our trade deficit in goods with the world is now nearly $800 billion dollars. 
We will further bring back our jobs by unleashing an American energy revolution – lifting restrictions on oil, coal, natural gas and all sources of American energy. This will create millions of jobs and lower the price of energy for all families. 
We are also going to secure our border to stop the drugs from pouring in. The Seattle-area recently experienced the largest number of heroin-related deaths in 20 years. We have to stop the drugs poisoning our communities. 
Another major issue in this race is foreign policy. Hillary Clinton has made one bad foreign policy decision after another – beginning with her support for going to war in Iraq in the first place, which I opposed. 
Her tenure as Secretary of State may be regarded as the most disastrous in U.S. history. 
Look at the world before and after she became Secretary of State. 
Pre-Hillary, in early 2009, Iraq was seeing a reduction in violence. 
Libya was stable. 
Syria was under control. 
The group we know today as ISIS was close to being extinguished. 
Iran was being choked by sanctions. 
Now, fast-forward to present time. 
After Hillary, here is what the world looks like: 
Iraq is in total chaos. 
Syria is in the midst of a disastrous civil war and a refugee crisis now threatens Europe and the United States. 
ISIS has been unleashed onto the entire world. 
Iran – the world's top state sponsor of terrorism – has been put on the path to nuclear weapons, and was given a $400 million dollar cash ransom payment. 
This is the legacy of Hillary Clinton: death, destruction and terrorism. 
America deserves a better legacy. 
All of you deserve a better future. I am the change agent. 
Hillary Clinton is the defender of the status quo. 
While our country lost badly under Hillary Clinton, she cashed in big time. Bill Clinton's speaking fees surged while Hillary was Secretary of State – Bill was paid almost $50 million dollars for speeches during her tenure, an increase of 44% over the previous 4 years. 
Then there was all the money funneled into the Clinton Foundation from foreign governments and corporations. 
It was pay-for-play. Just look at what she did with UBS, or the Russian Uranium, or disaster relief in Haiti, and so many other examples. 
But the only way to learn the full depth of her public corruption is to read the 33,000 emails she deleted. 
Hillary Clinton said under oath that she turned over all of her work-related emails. But we know that is one more Clinton lie. The FBI found thousands of work-related emails she never turned over, and then another 15,000 emails were just discovered a few weeks ago. 
Now, today, another 30 emails were discovered by the State Department that Hillary Clinton failed to turn over – these were emails about Benghazi. 
It just never ends with the Clintons. 
There is only one way to get justice in this rigged system and that is to show up and vote on November 8th – and to vote big. 
In A Trump Administration, the State Department will work for the country – not for Hillary Clinton's donors. 
Under Hillary Clinton, it's the powerful protecting the powerful. 
Politicians defending politicians. 
Insiders fighting for insiders. 
I am fighting for you. 
The government will work for citizens once again. 
The era of division will be replaced with a future of unity. 
We are going to do it by emphasizing what we all have in common. We will proudly promote our culture as Americans, the best in the world. 
It is time to break with the failures of the past, and to fight for every last child in this country to have the better future they deserve. 
This is the change I am promising all of you: an honest government, a thriving economy, and a just society for each and every American. 
I am asking for your vote so I can be your champion in the White House. 
Together, We Will Make America Wealthy Again. 
We Will Make America Strong Again. 
We Will Make America Proud Again. 
We Will Make America Safe Again. 
And We Will Make America Great Again. 
Thank you, and God Bless."
"Remarks at the Roberts Centre in Wilmington, Ohio","It's so great to be back in Ohio.
Come November, we are going to win this state, we are going to win the White House – and we are going to bring back your jobs.
We are going to negotiate fair trade deals that put American workers first.
We are going to stop the product dumping, the unfair foreign subsidies, and the currency manipulation. We are going to stop the foreign cheating.
The era of economic surrender is over.
A new era of American Greatness is beginning.
No state has been hurt worse by the Hillary Clinton trade policies than Ohio.
Hillary Clinton backed her husband's NAFTA, she backed China's entrance into the World Trade Organization, she backed the job-killing trade deal with South Korea, and backed the Trans-Pacific Partnership.
One bad deal after another.
Hillary Clinton's donors own her, and she will do whatever they tell her to do.
Ohio has lost nearly 1 in 3 manufacturing jobs since NAFTA, and nearly 1 in 4 manufacturing jobs since China entered the World Trade Organization.
Our trade deficit in goods with the world is now nearly $800 billion dollars. This subtracts directly from our growth – our economy grew only 1.1 percent in the last quarter, a total disaster.
This is the legacy of Hillary Clinton.
I am promising a new legacy for America.
We are going to create a New American Future.
But to do that, we have to stop the Trans-Pacific Partnership.
Our trade deficit with the proposed TPP member countries cost the state of Ohio more than 100,000 manufacturing jobs last year. Imagine how many more jobs would be lost if TPP was actually approved.
Hillary Clinton, who called the TPP the ""Gold Standard"", would 100% approve it if she ever got in.
We won't let that happen.
We will win this election, and we will keep America out of the TPP.
We will defend our freedom, our jobs, and our economic independence.
It's going to be America First.
My economic plan is going to grow this economy, raise your wages, and create millions of new jobs.
Here are a few of the things we will do:
A massive tax cut for working Americans.
We are going to eliminate regulations that kill American jobs, and that includes getting rid of the Obama Administration's new anti-energy rules that will raise Ohio energy bills by more than 40 percent.
Hillary Clinton says she wants to ""put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business."" Just like she wants to put the steel workers out of business.
We are going to put the miners and the steel workers back to work – and we are going to get your energy bills down.
We are going to repeal and replace Obamacare, saving another 2 million jobs over the next decade.
We are going to create jobs for all of our people, and we are going to fight to ensure that every young African-American and Latino child is put on the ladder of American success: a good education, and a great job.
Another major part of our agenda is immigration security. We need to protect American jobs. We need to protect American safety.
Last night, I outlined a detailed plan to provide jobs, safety and security to the American people with bold new immigration reforms.
I had a great meeting yesterday with the President of Mexico where we both expressed our shared desire to secure the border, put the cartels out of business, and to keep jobs in our hemisphere.
Let's also talk about government corruption.
No issue better illustrates how corrupt my opponent is than her pay-for-play scandals as Secretary of State.
Here is one example of Clinton Corruption.
As Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton signed off on a deal allowing Russians to take an increased stake in a company called Uranium One, giving up control of about 20 percent of America's uranium supply to the Russians. Clinton's approval of the deal netted the owners of the uranium company millions of dollars. In exchange for signing off on the deal, some of the former owners of Uranium One gave the Clinton Foundation millions of dollars in donations. In addition, Bill Clinton received $500,000 for a speech to a Kremlin-backed investment firm that was a beneficiary of the deal.
Here is another example of pay-for-play.
In 2009, Ericsson telecommunications came under U.S. pressure for selling telecom equipment to several oppressive governments – including Sudan, Syria, and Iran. Some these regimes used those technologies to monitor and control their own people.
In June 2011, Hillary Clinton's state department began adding goods and service to a list that might be covered under expanded sanctions on Iran and other state sponsors of terrorism.
During that time, Ericsson sponsored a speech by Bill Clinton, paying him $750,000 – his highest paying speech.
In April 2012, the Obama Administration issued an executive order imposing sanctions on telecom sales to Iran and Syria –but those sanctions did not cover Ericsson's work in Iran.
A Trump Administration will end the government corruption.
No one will be above the law.
We will have one set of rules for everyone. In Hillary Clinton's world, we have one set of rules for her – and another set of rules for everyone else.
I am fighting for everyone who doesn't have a voice. The forgotten men and women of America.
I am your voice.
Hillary Clinton's campaign is funded by Wall Street and hedge fund managers.
My campaign is powered by my own money, but also by small dollar donations from working people across this country who want their country back.
Nothing terrifies the ruling class more than when everyday working people give 5, 10, or 15 dollars to our campaign to help us take government away from the special interests and give it back to the voters.
Come November 8th, we are once again going to have a government that serves you, your family, and your country.
We are going to rebuild our depleted military, avoid needless foreign wars, build new friendships overseas, and remember those three famous words: Peace Through Strength.
We are going to work with our allies to crush, defeat, and utterly destroy ISIS.
We are going to have a new immigration screening test to keep people out of our country who don't support our tolerant values.
My tax reforms will add millions of new jobs and thousands of new small businesses.
My energy reforms will create millions of new jobs and lower the prince of your energy bill.
My trade reforms will raise wages, grow jobs and add trillions in new wealth into our country.
My immigration reforms will protect your jobs and stop businesses from exploiting visas programs that hurt poor workers.
My infrastructure plans will rebuild your roads, bridges and airports.
My regulatory reforms will make it easier for African-Americans small businesses to thrive, and for young children to live out their dreams.
My promise of school choice, charter schools and merit-pay for teachers will help low-income students in our inner cities. Hillary Clinton discriminates against poor African-American children by opposing school choice.
My government reforms will make your voice heard – not the voice of the special interests.
Every insider, getting rich off of our broken system, is throwing money at Hillary Clinton.
It's the powerful protecting the powerful.
Insiders fighting for insiders.
I am fighting for you.
Every day you turn on the nightly news, you hear about how some self-interested banker or some Washington insider says they oppose our campaign. Or some encrusted old politician says they oppose our campaign. Or some big time lobbyist says they oppose our campaign.
I wear their opposition as a badge of honor. Because it means I am fighting for REAL change, not just partisan change. I am fighting – all of us across the country are fighting – for peaceful regime change in our own country. The media-donor-political complex that's bled this country dry has to be replaced with a new government of, by and for the people.
I will fight to ensure that every American is treated equally, protected equally, and honored equally. We will reject bigotry and hatred and oppression in all of its forms, and seek a new future of security, prosperity and opportunity – a future built on our common culture and values as one American people.
I am asking for your vote so I can be your champion in the White House.
To every parent who dreams for their children, and to every child who dreams for their future, I say these words to you tonight: I'm with you, I will fight for you, and I will win for you.
Together, We Will Make America Strong Again.
We Will Make American Safe Again.
And We Will Make America Great Again.
Thank you, and God Bless."
"Remarks at a Rally at the Pensacola Bay Center in Pensacola, Florida","It is so great to be back in Florida, my second home. Let me also thank our good and dear friend, Chairman Jeff Miller, for joining us here today. We've worked closely together on developing much-needed reforms to take care of our Veterans.
Let me open by making this very important declaration: I love this state, I love the people of this state, and together we are going to have an amazing victory in November.
Decades of political failure and corruption will come swiftly to an end, and a New American Future will begin.
The citizens of this country will be in charge once more.
The special interests have had their day. That chapter in our history is closing.
The history book is closing on the failed politicians of yesterday. A new chapter is beginning, and this chapter will be authored by you, the American people.
This will be your time. You will be running the show. Not the donors, not the insiders, not the media executives.
Once more, we will have a government of, by and for the people.
All we have to do is cut our ties to the bitter failures of the past, and anything becomes possible.
Change is coming.
All the people who've rigged the system for their own personal benefit are trying to stop our change campaign because they know that their gravy train has reached its last stop.
It's your turn now. This is your time.
The fact that so many encrusted old political insiders oppose our campaign is the best proof you will ever need that we are fighting for real change – not partisan change.
We are fighting for all Americans – Democrats, Republicans, Independents, Conservatives, Liberals – who've been failed by this corrupt system. We're fighting for everyone who doesn't have a voice.
We're also fighting for every region of this country. For every part of Florida, and every part of America. From Pensacola to Pittsburgh, from Baltimore to Baton Rouge, we are fighting for every last city and every last person in this country.
Hillary Clinton is the candidate of the past.
Ours is the campaign of the future.
In this future, we are going to pursue new trade policies that put American workers first – and that keep jobs in our country. All the people who got NAFTA wrong, and China wrong, and who are trying to give us the Trans-Pacific Partnership – are the same failed voices pushing for Hillary Clinton.
Our trade deficit with the world is now nearly $800 billion dollars. We've lost one-third of our manufacturing jobs since Bill and Hillary Clinton gave us NAFTA. China is manipulating its currency and taking our jobs. We are going to stop companies from leaving our country and keep those jobs right here in America. The era of economic surrender is over.
We will also have a very strong border that stops people and drugs from illegally pouring into our country -- and we're going to build a border wall, and Mexico will pay for it.
In this new future, we are going to raise your wages. Household incomes are over $4,000 less today than they were in the year 2000.
My tax, trade, energy, immigration and regulation reforms will get your salaries and wages up. Hillary Clinton will continue the failed economic agenda that has only made her friends rich at your personal expense. Many people in this room tonight, and across this country, haven't seen a real wage increase in 18 years.
The people getting rich off of our rigged system have sent tens of millions of dollars to Hillary Clinton – much of it to her personal bank account – to keep you from having the future you deserve.
But on November 8th, you get to vote for the future you want.
In this future, we are going to pursue new education policies. At the center of my plan is school choice. I want every disadvantaged child in America to be able to attend the public or private school that is right for them and their family.
In this future, we are also going to keep our country out of the endless wars that have defined Hillary Clinton's career.
To keep our country out of war, we will remember those three very famous words: Peace Through Strength.
That means rebuilding our badly depleted military. I laid out a detailed plan this week to re-invest in our military and our troops.
We are going to build a 350 ship Navy, a 540,000 soldier Army, an Air Force of 1,200 combat-ready fighter jets, and a Marine Core built on 36 Battalions. Crucially, we are also going to pursue a state-of-the-art missile defense.
We will start by modernizing our cruisers to provide the Ballistic Missile Defense capability our nation needs.
As we expand our Navy toward the goal of 350 ships, we will also procure additional modern destroyers that are designed to handle the missile defense mission in the coming years.
Just today we were reminded of the need for missile defense after North Korea performed its fourth nuclear test since Hillary Clinton became Secretary of State.
One more massive Hillary Clinton failure.
Just like she failed in Iran and put them on the path to nuclear weapons.
Hillary Clinton has presided over the greatest series of foreign policy failures and blunders anyone has ever seen. Her policies have produced massive global disorder.
She handed Iraq over to ISIS, unleashing that terror group onto the world. ISIS would not be threatening the West today if not for the decisions Hillary Clinton made.
She helped destabilize Egypt by supporting the ouster of President Mubarak in exchange for the Muslim Brotherhood. Fortunately, President El-Sisi is now in charge, but terrorists have gained a foothold in that country.
She helped push Syria into a prolonged civil war by pushing regime change in that country too – without any plan for the day after.
She failed with China, which has only grown more aggressive. By the way, she also let China steal hundreds of billions of dollars in our intellectual property.
And of course, Hillary Clinton failed with her Russian Reset. She gave up missile defense in Poland and the Czech Republic in exchange for nothing in return. Then, she gave up 20% of U.S. uranium to Russia –while those who benefited from the deal gave money to the Clintons.
Let's not forget, Russia went into Crimea on President Obama's watch.
Unlike Clinton and Obama, we will negotiate with Russia from a position of strength – not weakness. And weakness is all we get from President Obama and Hillary Clinton.
The difference between me and my opponent on Vladimir Putin, and in all negotiations, is that I negotiate by creating leverage so I can extract a good deal for the United States.
Hillary Clinton negotiates but never gets anything of value for the United States. Putin laughs at our leaders, and takes them to the cleaners again and again.
That is why we will rebuild our military, strengthen our economy, and regain our position of leadership in the world – so we can negotiate from a position of great strength once again.
If I cannot get a good deal for the United States, I will follow the example of Ronald Reagan and walk away. That is completely contrary to the way President Obama and Hillary Clinton negotiate which gets nothing of value for the United States, ever. They just keep losing.
I will end this legacy of failure and strongly defend the interests of the United States.
But I will also keep focused on the ultimate goal. We will not seek endless conflict and hostility; we won't get trapped in the failed approaches of the past. A future where America can find common ground with countries like Russia and China is a better future for our children.
We will pursue these relationships with our eyes wide open, and a clear understanding of our many, many differences. I will advocate the American position with a strength and clarity President Obama and Hillary Clinton never have. No more apology tours. No more bowing to foreign powers. We proudly defend America at every single turn.
America will get the respect it deserves.
And if we don't, I will walk away from the deal like you've never seen anyone walk before. And, believe me, within a short while, they will come back -- but only on my terms, therefore the terms of the American people.
On these principles, we will pursue our long-term goals of peace – for the sake of our kids, and for the sake of the world's future.
Hillary Clinton has failed in every single country where she has ever gotten involved, and at a very high price for the world.
Her policies have produced only death and destruction, not diplomacy. She's trigger-happy, pushing recklessly for regime change – but never creating or promoting stability, or advancing the core interests of the United States.
Her only real achievement as Secretary of State has been getting away with her massive email scandal. She bleached, deleted and destroyed her emails after a subpoena from Congress.
She lied to Congress while under oath, and smashed her phones with a hammer to keep them from getting to authorities.
By the way, who has thirteen phones in the first place? Only somebody with a whole lot to hide.
And we all know what Hillary Clinton was hiding. She was hiding her pay-for-play scandals as Secretary of State.
Hillary Clinton isn't just part of the corrupt establishment, she is the corrupt establishment.
I just saw her press conference today where Hillary Clinton complained about all of the problems in the world. If only we'd had a competent Secretary of State who could have prevented all of these problems from happening.
Throughout it all, Hillary Clinton and her Foundation raked in millions and millions of dollars from the most oppressive and brutal regimes on earth. Hillary Clinton and her Foundation have cozied up to regimes that oppress and brutalize women, that murder gays, and that violate human rights on an unimaginable scale.
My Administration will be a voice for all people who are oppressed, including the millions of women being oppressed by Radical Islam.
Hillary Clinton has been there for 30 years and produced only failure. Yet people keep giving her money and protecting her.
It's the powerful protecting the powerful.
The insiders fighting for insiders.
I am fighting for you.
All the people advising Hillary Clinton are the people responsible for the endless wars and conflicts, and the tragedies in the Middle East.
I am proud to have the support of the retired generals and admirals who know how to win – and how to avoid endless war.
Let me also take this moment to express our deepest thanks and gratitude to everyone who has worn the uniform, but most especially to those who have given the ultimate sacrifice for this country.
There is no greater expression of love than the love shown by the men and women who have laid down their lives for their country and its people.
It is our duty to ensure that their sacrifices are not in vain. That means we don't issue timetables for political reasons, but that we work with our generals and our leaders to produce a real plan for victory.
We will pursue a new, steady foreign policy that seeks to advance the national security interests of the United States – not a reckless, interventionist globalism that has failed this country so badly.
And we will be clear in naming our enemy: Radical Islamic Terrorism.
The fact that Hillary Clinton can't even say these words proves how unfit she is to lead this country. This is one single fact she can never escape.
Any country that shares our goal of defeating this enemy will be our partner in this mission.
We will break the cycle of regime change, and refugee crisis, that has gone on for so many years.
We simply can't afford to continue down the road we are on right now.
That applies to everything.
Change is needed at every single level of our society.
When I talk about making America Great Again, I'm talking about creating a future that includes each and every American.
I want the most inclusive, generous and prosperous society we have ever had.
The possibilities for our future are unlimited.
The Hillary Clinton campaign is so small, so petty, so tired.
If we just break from this bitter, divisive past, we can achieve anything.
That also means breaking from the lies and the deceit of the Clintons. They want to scare you out of voting for change. The most recent smear comes from Bill Clinton, who said that the theme of Make America Great Again is somehow racist – now they've unearthed video footage of Bill Clinton repeatedly using this same phrase. It's just one more Clinton lie, one more desperate slander to keep the people from having the future they deserve.
When I talk about Making America Great Again, I'm talking about making it Great Again for Everyone – but especially for all of the Americans who have been left behind.
We are the campaign of unity, and we will deliver amazing things for all of our people.
New schools, new factories, new infrastructure.
Beautiful skyscrapers will rise all across this nation. We will develop Detroit, Not Beijing.
Most importantly, we will fight to end the systemic poverty in our inner cities, and to lift millions of African-Americans and Hispanics out of poverty.
Here, in Florida, we have such an amazing and diverse community of Hispanic-Americans – from Cuba, from Puerto Rico, from Venezuela, from Haiti, from all over.
These incredible Americans will have in Donald J. Trump a President who is determined to fight for their jobs, their wages, their schools, and their futures.
To all Hispanic-Americans who want better jobs and higher wages: I will be your champion.
All working people, of all backgrounds and from all places, will have a true friend in Donald Trump.
In particular, I have a very special place in my heart for those who make a living as tradesmen, craftsmen and construction workers.
I've spent my professional life among construction workers, bricklayers, electricians and plumbers. I feel more comfortable around blue collar workers than Wall Street executives. There's a reason the hedge fund managers are funding Hillary Clinton's campaign, and not mine.
My campaign is powered by my own money, but also small dollar donations from people like all of you who just want their country back.
This is our chance. It's our last chance to give the people control over their own futures once again.
Gleaming new plants stretching across our nation.
Young Latino children getting an amazing education at the school of their choice – and their parents having their jobs protected from unfair competition.
Our Veterans will get the best healthcare in the world. You can read the whole plan on our website, DonaldJTrump.com.
Massive tax reductions and tax simplification – so that you can keep more of your precious time and your hard-earned money. Hillary Clinton wants to raise your taxes big time.
Most importantly, 2017 will be about unity.
Once again, we will be One American Nation.
We Will Be One American People.
Just imagine what we can accomplish together if we set aside our differences, and focus on what we have in common as Americans.
We will be one people, living under One God, saluting one beautiful American Flag.
We Will Make America Proud Again.
We Will Make America Prosperous Again.
We Will Make America Safe Again.
Friends and fellow citizens, We Will Make America Great Again!"
